# Terms and Definitions

## EPU

Windows desktop application developed by ThermoFisher, serving as the original piece of electron microscopy acquisition software. EPU (Enhanced Productivity User interface) provides comprehensive control over data collection parameters and automation workflows for cryo-electron microscopy experiments.

## SPA

Single Particle Analysis - A computational method in cryo-electron microscopy used to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules from individual particle images embedded in vitreous ice.

## Athena / Athena API

Decision-making software developed by ThermoFisher for automated cryo-electron microscopy workflows. The Athena API provides programmatic access to session management, decision recording, and algorithm results for optimised data collection strategies.

## ARIA

Automated Real-time Image Analysis system developed by INSTRUCT-ERIC for real-time processing and quality assessment of cryo-electron microscopy data during acquisition. More information available at: https://instruct-eric.org/help/about-aria

## Atlas

A comprehensive overview image of the entire grid, composed of individual tiles arranged in a 5Ã—5 grid pattern. The atlas provides spatial context and navigation reference for subsequent high-magnification data collection across the specimen grid.

## Grid Square

Individual sections of the electron microscopy grid that contain the specimen of interest. Grid squares are selected based on ice quality, specimen distribution, and other quality metrics for detailed imaging at higher magnifications.

## Foil Hole

Circular openings in the carbon support film of the electron microscopy grid where the biological specimen is suspended in vitreous ice. These holes provide areas of minimal background interference for high-resolution imaging of embedded particles.

## Micrograph

High-resolution electron microscopy images captured from individual foil holes or grid squares, containing the embedded biological specimens used for subsequent image processing and structural analysis.
