## Status

In Progress

## Context

Do we want to have separate queues for different types of processing data feedback which will lead to
different method calls (i.e. CTF results vs. particle picking results)?

The other option would be to have the messages contain something to indicate the relevant callback method.

## Decision

What decision we made.

## Consequences

What we will do as a result of this decision.
